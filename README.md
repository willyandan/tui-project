# TUI Backend

## Introduction

> Briefing:For the purpose of this exercise, we're in a post-covid world without travel restrictions where the end user is a traveler using  
the internet to find hotel options.  
Your challenge is to build a 'microsite' and/or API that provides a functional solution for travelers to find the best and/or cheapest hotels available  
in the destinations specified below.  
In addition to providing visitors with a selection of offers for each destination, we also want to provide information on the local climate & weather.
